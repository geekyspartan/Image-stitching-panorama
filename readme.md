# Image Alignment, Panoramas

Implemented the method to generate Panoramas for three images using Homography and Cylindrical warping.


To run code, execute the following command

Python command:

> python main.py [Number] [Path of center image] [Path of right image] [Path of left image] ./

Number parameter has the following values:

* 1 - Homography Warping 
* 2 - Cylindrical Warping
* 3 - Homography Warping + Laplacian Blending
* 4 - Cylindrical Warping + Laplacian Blending

An output panorama view is saved after executing command.
